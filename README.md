### PyeeControl

PyeeControl is a Yeelight control application built with python using the [YeeLight Python library](https://yeelight.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)


It uses Tkinter to build a rudimentary app for finding and controlling Yeelight smart bulbs on your network.


## How to Use

Simply press `Search For Bulbs` and wait for your bulbs to be found


After the bulbs have appeared in the window press `Toggle All` to toggle the lights on/off

# Changing Colors

Pressing `Change Color` will prompt you to select a color for the light, if the lights are on the color will be changed!

# Selecting and Toggling a Flow

There are a couple of premade *Flows*, light scenes such as 'Police' which will alternate your light's colors between red and blue. Select a flow scene from the dropdown menu and then press `Toggle Flow` to start and stop the flow.

# Matching the Screen Color

Toggling the `Screen Match` checkbox will start automatically matching the color of your yeelight devices with the average color of your screen. **Note:** This feature can be resource intensive and is not guaranteed to work perfectly
